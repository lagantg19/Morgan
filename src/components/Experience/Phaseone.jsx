            <b>üë®‚Äçüè´Hirevue interview </b>:-Following the coding round of the
            selection process, all participants, regardless of their
            performance, were presented with a unique opportunity: the HireVue
            video interview. This stage aimed to assess not only coding skills
            but also verbal communication and problem-solving abilities. Each
            candidate encountered two managerial questions, algorithmically
            generated. A mere 30 seconds were granted for preparation, and
            subsequently, a two-minute response was to be recorded and
            submitted. Two attempts were permitted, with the second attempt
            automatically submitted. This segment of the evaluation was designed
            to gauge proficiency in articulation and the adeptness in managing
            unexpected scenarios.
            <br />
            My personal experience involved responding to two distinct
            questions. The first pertained to explaining my career aspirations,
            prompting introspection and the articulation of my professional
            ambitions. The second question delved into conflict resolution
            within a team context.
